This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2061

Tries to look as clear as pyte but a little less saturated with a slight "warm" touch.

Edit: I removed the screenshot as I won't continue to work on this theme anymore. If you really like it and want to see it developed further, contact me (e.g. via http://leetless.de), if I see theres still a bunch of people wo like to see me working on this theme, I might decide to do so.
